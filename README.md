Controls the tv duh


To run you need to implement a `Secrets` object so the `LGTVConfig` can load (mainly because I couldn't be bothered to mess around with config loaders). The values to put in the config were found somewhere deep in the settings on the TV (recommend googling how to find these for your particular model).
